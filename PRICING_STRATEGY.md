## 📊 Psychology Behind the Pricing

### Price Anchoring
- Show 6-month plan first (default)
- "or $2,497 paid in full (save $505)" makes full payment look like a deal

### Loss Aversion
- Customers see savings when paying in full
- Creates urgency to choose "smart" option

### Affordability Illusion
- "$250/month" sounds WAY better than "$1,500"
- Mental accounting: monthly fits budgets easier

### Commitment Device
- Payment plan = serious customers only
- Filters out tire-kickers

## 💬 Sales Scripts

### Phone/Email Inquiry:
> "Great question about pricing! We offer flexible payment options to make it super easy. The Professional package is $1,497 total, but you can spread that into 6 monthly payments of just $250. Most clients love this option because it fits their budget while they're growing. Would you prefer to pay in full and save $303, or spread it out?"

### Objection: "That's too expensive"
> "I totally understand. That's exactly why we created payment plans. Instead of $1,497 upfront, you can start for just $250 this month and pay over 6 months. Think of it as $8/day to have a professional website, social media, and video working for you 24/7. That's less than two coffees!"

### Objection: "Can I cancel anytime?"
> "This is a one-time project, not a subscription. Once we complete your website and marketing setup (usually 14-21 days), it's yours forever. The payment plan is just a flexible way to pay for the project over time, like financing a car or furniture. You're not locked into ongoing monthly fees unless you choose optional add-ons like maintenance."
