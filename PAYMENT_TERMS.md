## 💡 Pricing Psychology Explained

### Why 50% Deposit Works:

**Traditional Model (100% Upfront):**
- "I need $1,497 today" ❌
- High barrier to entry
- Long sales cycle
- Lost customers to price shock

**Our Model (50% Deposit + Payments):**
- "I need $748 today" ✅
- Lower initial commitment
- Faster decision-making
- More affordable perception

**Customer Thinking:**
> "I can afford $748 now, and $125/month is like a Netflix subscription. This is totally doable!"

---

## 🎨 Marketing Messaging

### How We Present This:

**Homepage:**
> "Start your digital transformation for just $349 down, then spread the rest over 6 easy payments. No interest. No hidden fees. Just results."

**Sales Call:**
> "The Professional package is $1,497 total. Most clients do $748 today to start, then $125/month for 6 months. That's only $4 per day for a complete digital presence. Or save 10% and pay $1,347 in full."

**Email Campaign:**
Subject: "Launch Your Website for $349 (Then Pay as You Grow)"
> "We've made it easier than ever to get started. Put down 50% to secure your project, then pay the rest over 6 months at 0% interest. It's like financing a website, but without the banks!"
